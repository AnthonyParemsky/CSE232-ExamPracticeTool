1. The std in std::cout is an example of
what part of C++?
(a) A namespace
(b) An exception
(c) A variable
(d) A file
(e) A class
(f) A function
(g) A using
(h) An object

2. The definition of a publicly accessible function template should be put in what file?
(a) The header file
(b) The main file
(c) The template file
(d) The implementation file

3. What is output from this code?
template<typename T>
void func(T const & arg) {
  cout << arg << ’!’;
}
int main() {
  func(3.5);
  func(3 == 5);
  func(string("hi"));
}
(a) The code generates a run-time error.
(b) The code generates a syntax error.
(c) 3.5!false!hi!
(d) 3.5!0!hi!
(e) 3.5!\nfalse!\nhi!\n
(f) None of the above.

4. What is the difference between lambda expressions and named functions?
(a) Lambdas must be defined in implementation files.
(b) Lambdas can have capture lists.
(c) Lambdas are used as arguments to algorithms, functions are not.
(d) Lambdas always copy their arguments, functions can use references
and pointers to avoid copying.
(e) Lambdas always take two parameters,
functions can take 0 or more parameters.
(f) There is no difference between a
lambda and a named function.

5. Which of the following have access to all
private member attributes?
(a) Const member functions of other
classes
(b) operator>>
(c) Generic algorithms
(d) The main() function
(e) None of the above

6. Making a class templated allows which
of the following capabilities to be possible?
(a) A matrix class that can have many
different numbers of rows and
columns
(b) A container class that can hold different types of elements
(c) A class that can be written to different output streams
(d) A string class that can hold many different letters, digits, and whitespace
characters
(e) All of the above

7. In the lab where you wrote the fill random
member function of Table, why was
it described as a bad idea to use
std::random_device repeatedly to generate random numbers?
(a) Because it is slow.
(b) Because it depletes sources of randomness available to other processes.
(c) Both of the above.
(d) None of the above (this is the recommended technique).

8. Which of the following is true about templates?
(a) Parameterized types are required to
call function templates
(b) Templates allow a class to hold many
elements
(c) Function objects, like Less-than from
Section 7.3.2, are function templates.
(d) Only function templates can access
private attributes of a class
(e) None of the above are true

9. Is the following legal?
template <typename T>
class Node {
  public:
    T data_;
  private:
    Node<T> * next_;
};
(a) No, a class must have function members.
(b) No, a data member cannot be a
pointer.
(c) No, it has a syntax error.
(d) No, a type cannot refer to itself.
(e) Yes, it is legal.

10. What special privileges does a friend function have over a class?
(a) It can call deleted functions.
(b) It can make public members private.
(c) It can define the operator<<.
(d) It can alter const objects.
(e) None of the above.

11. Where should library function templates be
specified?
(a) Templated functions must be put in a
template file (extension .tmp)
(b) In a header file
(c) In both a header and implementation
file
(d) In a implementation file

12. Why should you often make data members
private?
(a) To enforce encapsulation via access
control.
(b) Because data members have to be private in a class.
(c) Because friend functions can only access private data members.
(d) Because getters and setters can only
work on private data members.
(e) None of the above.

13. What is the primary benefit for using
lambda expressions?
(a) To be able to define a single-use function right where it is needed.
(b) Because lambda functions can access
private data members.
(c) Because lambda functions can have
multiple parameters.
(d) Because function templates require
lambda expressions to work.
(e) None of the above.

14. What is the primary benefit to writing function templates?
(a) So that the function runs faster.
(b) So that the function compiles faster.
(c) So that the function is throws exceptions.
(d) So that the function is generic.
(e) So that the function is composited.
(f) None of the above.

15. Which of the following expressions have
type int, assuming vec is a 2-dimensional
table with 3 rows and 2 columns and has
type vector<vector<int>>.
(a) vec.size()
(b) vec[1].size()
(c) vec[1][0]
(d) vec[0]
(e) Two of (a-d) have type int.
(f) Three of (a-d) have type int.
(g) Four of (a-d) have type int.
