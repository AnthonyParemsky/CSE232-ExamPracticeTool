1. What happens if an exception is thrown in
a program, but it is never caught?
(a) It causes a compile time error, but
only if a debugger is being used.
(b) It causes a compile time error, but
only if a debugger is NOT being used.
(c) It causes a runtime error.
(d) The main function will catch it and
prompt the user for direction.
(e) It generates undefined behavior.
(f) None of the above.

2. What key can you press to auto-complete
a partially typed filename at the command
line?
(a) Return
(b) Control-A
(c) Control-D
(d) Control-Q
(e) Tab
(f) None of the above.

3. Which techniques are ways for a function to
communicate information?
(a) Changing a non-const reference argument
(b) Writing to standard output
(c) Assigning to a dereferenced pointer
argument
(d) Returning a value
(e) Throwing an exception
(f) All of the above

4. What happens if code in a try raises an
exception that isn’t the one a catch block
specifies?
(a) The catch block executes, but the
same exception is raised at the end.
(b) The try block ceases executing at the
point of the raised exception.
(c) The try block finishes, then the exception is raised again.
(d) The what member function on the exception is called.
(e) None of the above.

5. Why should data members generally be
made private?
(a) To prevent exceptions from being
thrown in the class constructor.
(b) To allow for separate compilation of
multiple implementation files.
(c) To improve the performance (speed)
of the class.
(d) To improve the readability of the class
definition.
(e) To protect the data members from being changed without validation by the
class.

6. Why do we recommend static casting the
result of the size method on containers?
(a) Because implicit casting results in
run-time exceptions.
(b) Because working with unsigned ints
can cause a number of common mistakes.
(c) Because calling size on an empty container is undefined behavior.
(d) Because the size of a container can
change if elements are added or removed.
(e) Because the type returned is compiler
dependent.
(f) None of the above.

7. What happens when an assertion fails?
(a) The program is immediately halted.
(b) An entry is added to the log (which
can be accessed via gdb when the -g
is used.
(c) An exception is thrown that can be
caught by a matching catch statement.
(d) Assertions cant fail, so the question is
nonsensical.
(e) An error message is displayed and the
opportunity is given to resume the
program from that point.
(f) A warning is presented at compiletime, provided -Wall is used.

8. If you expect a function your code will call
may raise an exception, which keywords are
needed to handle the exception?
(a) try
(b) finally
(c) except
(d) throw
(e) catch
(f) None of the above.
(g) 2 of the above.
(h) 3 of the above.
(i) All of the above.

9. In order to use the assert function, you need
to include the cassert header. What does
the c in the name mean?
(a) That the function runs at compile
time.
(b) That the header is from the C language.
(c) That the function requires a compiler
pre-processor.
(d) None of the above.

10. When can you use a catch block without a
try block?
(a) When it is unclear where an exception
can be thrown.
(b) When you want the code in the block
to always run.
(c) When any exception can be caught.
(d) When the statement immediately before it may raise an exception.
(e) None of the above.

11. You are trying to rename a file, named
“main.cpp”, to be called “test.cpp”. You
type “mv mai<TAB>”, that is you type the
first few letters of the filename and press
the TAB key. Nothing happens. What does
this mean?
(a) That the “test.cpp” file is interfering
with the copy.
(b) That there is no file in the working
directory that starts with “mai”.
(c) That “main.cpp” is not part of the
PATH.
(d) Of course nothing happens, filenames
can’t contain whitespace.
(e) That you need a ”-r” to move readonly files.
(f) That you misspelled the “mv” command.

12. When should a function throw an exception?
(a) When the function attempts to access
a private data member.
(b) When the function needs a default parameter.
(c) When the function catches an exception.
(d) When the function encounters an error that the caller should handle.
(e) When the function attempts to perform a complicated calculation.
(f) When the function attempts to read
from a stream.

13. Which of the following is true about assertions?
(a) They are part of the <assert> library.
(b) A true argument results in an error.
(c) They should be used to indicate failures to the user (not the programmer).
(d) They can generate compile-time errors.
(e) They aren’t used in modern C++
code.
(f) They can generate run-time errors.
(g) None of the above are true.

(b) e
(c) Control-C
(d) Control-D
(e) q
(f) None of the above are correct.
